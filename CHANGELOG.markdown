# Do More with Tabs #

A limited but useful Firefox WebExtension for manipulating tabs.


## Release Notes ##

- 1.0b1, 2017-06-02: First publicly available version, via GitHub and (some time later) AMO. Added hiding of inapplicable menu items. Improved handling of pinned tabs and private windows.
- 1.0a5, 2017-05-21: Added "New Window for Domain" and "Merge All Windows" as menu items.
- 1.0a4, 2017-05-14: Internationalisation, even if it's only (British?) English so far. Refactored much of the code while I was at it.
- 1.0a3, 2017-05-07: Reorganised the context menu to its intended final version 1.0 state. Added "Move Tab to Start", "Move Tab to End" and "Split Window Here" as menu items. Added keyboard shortcuts for "New Tab Here" and "Duplicate Tab".
- 1.0a2, 2017-05-01: Rewrote DMT as a submenu in the tab context menu. Added some actual functionality: "New Tab Here" and "Duplicate Tab" menu items.
- 1.0a1, 2017-04-26: An SVG, a ``browser_action`` toolbar button, and a few vague ideas.
